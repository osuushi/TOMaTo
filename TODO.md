# Chat Interface

## Conversation View:

1. Make code blocks in markdown copyable
2. Do syntax highlighting on code blocks
3. Make chat output scroll to bottom while outputting
4. Disable Text input while outputting
5. Add switching between models
6. Add support for saving conversation
7. Support for multiple conversations
8. Conversation box should be content editable / growable
9. Add setting for send on enter vs cmd-enter
10. Better markdown library? this one seems to output random extra lines sometimes, maybe needs post-processing, not sure

# Settings Page

1. Add billing information to show how much you've used (maybe also in sidebar somehow?)
2. Save window size and reopen at that size
3. Better support for inputting keyboard shortcut, very difficult to figure out right now

# Dev

1. Stop raising window on every restart / reload (something changed around when
   the service was introduced)
2. Fix source map errors in app?
